Final Project on “Predicting heart disease” 


Problem Statement –

You are the Data Scientist at a medical research facility. The facility wants you to build a machine learning model to classify if given the data of a patient should tell if the patient is at risk of heart attack


Heart Disease Dataset:

UCI Heart Disease Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease?spm=5176.100239.blogcont54260.8.TRNGoO)


Lab Environment: Jupiter Notebooks

Domain – Healthcare
 
Tasks to be done:
 
 
Data Analysis:
Import the dataset
Get information about dataset (mean, max, min, quartiles etc.)
Find the correlation between all fields.

Data Visualization:
Visualize the number of patients having a heart disease and not having a heart disease.
Visualize the age and weather patient has disease or not
Visualize correlation between all features using a heat map
Logistic Regression:
Build a simple logistic regression model 
Divide the dataset in 70:30 ratio
Build the model on train set and predict the values on test set
Build the confusion matrix and get the accuracy score

Decision Tree:
Build a decision tree model
Divide the dataset in 70:30 ratio
Build the model on train set and predict the values on test set
Build the confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy


Random Forest:
Build a Random Forest model 
Divide the dataset in 70:30 ratio
Build the model on train set and predict the values on test set
Build the confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy

Select the best model
